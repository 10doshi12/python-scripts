This is a collection of short Python scripts use in Linux.
I have these added to my `PATH`
[variable](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Environment_variables)
to run from anywhere.
None are currently available in [pip][pip],
but I will add them if enough people are interested.

To add these to your `PATH`, clone the repo and add the following
to your `bashrc` or `zshrc`, replacing `<python-scripts>`
with the location of the cloned repository.
See my [dotfiles][dotfiles] repo for my
complete Mac and Linux system configurations.

```Bash
# Add additional directories to the path.
pathadd() {
  [ -d "$1" ] && [[ ":$PATH:" != *":$1:"* ]] && PATH="${PATH:+"$PATH:"}$1"
}

pathadd <python-scripts>/python2.7
pathadd <python-scripts>/python3
```

# Dependencies
These scripts are written in Python 3 except when external
libraries don't support Python 3.
Dependencies for Python 2 and 3 for all scripts are
included in `requirements-{2,3}.txt` and can be installed
using `pip` with `pip3 install -r requirements-3.txt`.

# Scripts

## [generate-readme.py](https://github.com/bamos/python-scripts/blob/master/generate-readme.py)
+ Authors: [Brandon Amos](http://github.com/bamos)
+ Created: 2015.03.27


Generates the README for
[bamos/python-scripts](https://github.com/bamos/python-scripts).
Script descriptions are obtained by parsing the docstrings.



## [python2.7/mt.py](https://github.com/bamos/python-scripts/blob/master/python2.7/mt.py)
+ Authors: [Brandon Amos](https://github.com/bamos)
+ Created: 2014.11.30


This script implements the simple
[multitail](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/multitail)
example to tail multiple files and append the filename to the beginning
of the output.



## [python2.7/music-organizer.py](https://github.com/bamos/python-scripts/blob/master/python2.7/music-organizer.py)
+ Authors: [Brandon Amos](https://github.com/bamos)
+ Created: 2014.04.19


This script (music-organizer.py) organizes my music collection for
iTunes and [mpv](http://mpv.io) using tag information.
The directory structure is `<artist>/<track>`, where `<artist>` and `<track>`
are lower case strings separated by dashes.



## [python3/eval-expr.py](https://github.com/bamos/python-scripts/blob/master/python3/eval-expr.py)
+ Authors: J. Sebastian, [Brandon Amos](https://github.com/bamos)
+ Created: 2013.08.01


A module to evaluate a mathematical expression using Python's AST.

+ Original by: J. Sebastian at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2371436.
+ Modifications by: [Brandon Amos](https://github.com/bamos).

If you want a command-line expression evaluator, use
[Russell91/pythonpy](https://github.com/Russell91/pythonpy).


```
$ eval-expr.py '(((4+6)*10)<<2)'
(((4+6)*10)<<2) = 400
```



## [python3/get-osx-wallpaper.py](https://github.com/bamos/python-scripts/blob/master/python3/get-osx-wallpaper.py)
+ Authors: [Brandon Amos](https://github.com/bamos)
+ Created: 2015.03.25


This is a Python script that outputs the path of the current
OSX wallpaper.
This is helpful when the desktop wallpaper is randomized
across a large collection of pictures and you want to
delete the current wallpaper.


### Warning
+ This approach doesn't work with multiple monitors.

### Tested On
+ OSX Yosemite 10.10.2 with a single monitor on a MBP.

### Usage
Ensure `db_path` and `wallpaper_dir` are correctly set below.

Assuming `get-osx-wallpaper.py` is on your path,
check the output with the following

```
$ get-osx-wallpaper.py
/Users/bamos/Pictures/wallpaper/nature/496.jpg
```

Please ensure this is correct before trying to remove it!

This can be paired with other commands such as `open` or `rm`.
Run `killall Dock` to refresh the changes after removing the file.
Note that the dock will be restarted and all windows will be
unminimized.

```
$ open $(get-osx-wallpaper.py)
$ rm $(get-osx-wallpaper.py) && killall Dock
```

Example alias definitions for bash and zsh are available in
https://github.com/bamos/dotfiles/blob/master/.aliases:

```
alias open-wallpaper='open $(get-osx-wallpaper.py)'
alias rm-wallpaper='rm $(get-osx-wallpaper.py) && killall Dock'
```

## [python3/merge-mutt-contacts.py](https://github.com/bamos/python-scripts/blob/master/python3/merge-mutt-contacts.py)
+ Authors: [Brandon Amos](https://github.com/bamos)
+ Created: 2014.01.08


Merges two mutt contact files.



## [python3/merge-pdfs-printable.py](https://github.com/bamos/python-scripts/blob/master/python3/merge-pdfs-printable.py)
+ Authors: [Brandon Amos](https://github.com/bamos)
+ Created: 2014.10.17


The printers in my office print a cover page before every job, and
I don't like printing many cover pages if I want to submit multiple
papers separately so that the papers don't overlap. This script will
merge PDF documents and insert blank pages so that the printed pages
won't overlap documents. The modulo option is helpful to print 2 PDF
pages per physical page side.

The script uses PyPDF2 to merge the documents and to extract the
number of pages in the input documents and ghostscript to create a
blank PDF page.

```
$ merge-pdfs-printable.py a.pdf b.pdf c.pdf --modulo 4
a.pdf
  + Pages: 6
  + Added 2 blank pages.
b.pdf
  + Pages: 13
  + Added 3 blank pages.
c.pdf
  + Pages: 13
  + Added 3 blank pages.
Merged output is in '/tmp/tmpm2n5g0mh-merge.pdf'.
```

Note: Some of my decrypted PDF documents have resulted in
PyPDF2.utils.PdfReadError: file has not been decrypted. My current
workaround solution is to run pdf2ps on the PDF and then ps2pdf on the
PS file.
