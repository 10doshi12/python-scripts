#
# This is a Python script that outputs the path of the current
# OSX wallpaper.
# This is helpful when the desktop wallpaper is randomized
# across a large collection of pictures and you want to
# delete the current wallpaper.

# --- Warning ---
# + This approach doesn't work multiple monitors.
#
# --- Tested On ---
# + OSX Yosemite 10.10.2 with a single monitor on a MBP.
#
# --- Usage ---
# Ensure `db_path` and `wallpaper_dir` are correctly set below.
#
# Assuming `get-osx-wallpaper.py` is on your path,
# check the output with the following
#
#   $ get-osx-wallpaper.py
#   /Users/bamos/Pictures/wallpaper/nature/496.jpg
#
# Please ensure this is correct before trying to remove it!
#
# This can be paired with other commands such as `open` or `rm`.
# Run `killall Dock` to refresh the changes after removing the file.
#
#   $ open $(get-osx-wallpaper.py)
#   $ rm $(get-osx-wallpaper.py) && killall Dock
#
# Example alias definitions for bash and zsh are available in
# https://github.com/bamos/dotfiles/blob/master/.aliases:
#
#    alias open-wallpaper='open $(get-osx-wallpaper.py)'
#    alias rm-wallpaper='rm $(get-osx-wallpaper.py) && killall Dock'
